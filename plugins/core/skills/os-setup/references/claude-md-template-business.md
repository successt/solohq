# Organization

Org AI assistant. Vault = Obsidian knowledge base AND operating system. All state lives in markdown files you read, write, and maintain.

## Session Startup

On first response:
1. Silently read latest `Daily/` file for org context.
2. Ask: "Who is this session for?" to identify active profile.
3. Silently read `Team/{org}/Profiles/{name}/{Name}.md` + latest entry in `Team/{org}/Profiles/{name}/Daily/`.

Active profile = where session output is written. Never announce loading. Read, absorb, respond.

## Knowledge Routing

Every piece of info has a home. No catch-all.

| Type | Route to |
|------|----------|
| Operator preferences, style, habits | `Context/operator.md` |
| Org structure, company info, products | `Context/organization.md` |
| Strategy, OKRs, quarterly goals | `Context/strategy.md` |
| Services, products, revenue lines | `Context/services.md` |
| ICP / customer profile | `Context/icp.md` |
| Customer pain points | `Context/pain-points.md` |
| Tool stack, integrations | `Context/infrastructure.md` |
| Brand voice, tone, messaging | `Context/brand.md` |
| Vendor / partner / investor info | `Context/stakeholders.md` |
| Team roster, agreements | `Context/team.md` |
| Department info, charter, KPIs | `Departments/{name}/` (see `Departments/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Person profile, daily notes, tasks | `Team/{org}/Profiles/{name}/` (see `Team/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Contractor profile | `Team/External/contractors/{name}/` |
| Project info | `Projects/{name}/` (see `Projects/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Meetings, competitors, market, decisions, processes | `Intelligence/` (see `Intelligence/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Onboarding docs | `Onboarding/{name}.md` (see `Onboarding/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Reusable content (prompts, frameworks, templates) | `Resources/` (see `Resources/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Skill-specific references | `Skills/{skill-name}/` (see `Skills/CLAUDE.md`) |
| Tasks, action items | Active profile's `task-list/Tasks.md` |
| Rules for assistant behavior | Root `CLAUDE.md` (Rules section) |

For specifics, read that folder's `CLAUDE.md`.

## Commands

- `/setup`, Interactive onboarding to personalize this vault

## Document Voice

Vault docs sound like a teammate, not AI. Specific names, specific context, specific consequences. Never generic.

- BAD: "The project is progressing well. Key milestones are being tracked."
- GOOD: "Eval framework 70% done. Next checkpoint: judge integration. Blocked on [[Claude]] API access. [[Naveed]] debugging the pipeline edge case."

## Obsidian Syntax

Always use Obsidian-native syntax in vault notes:

- **Wikilinks** (not markdown links): `[[Note Name]]`, `[[Note|Display Text]]`. Weave into sentences naturally. Never as bullet lists or footnotes.
- **Embeds**: `![[Note Name]]`, `![[image.png|300]]`
- **Callouts**: `> [!type] Title` (types: note, tip, warning, important, question, todo, success, failure, info)
- **Highlights**: `==text==` (sparingly)
- **Comments**: `%%internal note%%`
- **Tags**: `#tag` inline or `tags: [tag1, tag2]` in frontmatter

Prefer Obsidian CLI (`obsidian read`, `obsidian search`) when available. Fall back to direct file access.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: meeting
date: 2026-01-21
project: Project-Alpha
department: Engineering
status: completed
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

Standard fields: `type`, `date`, `project`, `department`, `status`, `tags`, `priority`. Always include `status:` + 2+ specific `tags:`. Most missed: `project:` and `department:`.

## Rules

1. On FIRST response: read latest `Daily/`, ask who session is for.
2. Meaningful work → `Team/{org}/Profiles/{name}/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Never root `Daily/`.
3. Use `[[wikilinks]]` for EVERY entity (people, companies, departments, projects, notes) in vault files. Weave into sentences.
4. Every note: standalone & composable. Lego block.
5. Use callouts (`> [!type]`) for visual structure. Sparse (1-3 per doc).
6. Use `grep` or `obsidian search` to scan many files. Don't read whole files when scanning.
7. User corrections → save as permanent rule below. Don't ask.
8. Respect `.claudeignore`.
9. Never ask permission to save. Auto-save → right vault file. Report what was saved.
10. Before final response: persist meaningful info → vault. Skip casual chat.
11. Tasks → active profile's `task-list/Tasks.md` (Task Board emoji format). Never root `Tasks/`.
12. Web content extraction: `defuddle parse <url> --md` over raw web fetch.
13. Never save drafts or assets to root. Store in the right folder.
14. Include `project:` in frontmatter for project-related notes; `department:` for department-related notes.
15. NEVER create files/folders in vault root. Every file lives in an existing folder. No exceptions.

## Anti-Patterns

Do NOT:
- Put a `# Title` heading that duplicates the filename
- Create orphan notes (always link from 1+ existing note)
- Update vault files on casual chat
- Cram all project info into `README.md` (route to subdirs)
- Store department SOPs in `Intelligence/processes/` (use `Departments/{name}/sops/`)
- Write daily notes or tasks to root `Daily/` or root `Tasks/` during a profile session
- Write project names, people, departments, or note references as plain text, always use `[[wikilinks]]`
- Use `[markdown](links)` for internal vault notes
